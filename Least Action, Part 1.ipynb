    "First of all, Lagrangian mechanics was invented as just a way of formulating and solving Newton's Law. It uses the concepts of kinetic and potential energy. You can solve some systems way easier using the Lagrangian formulation than if you directly used Newton's Laws. Later physicists discovered that the heart of the Lagrangian formulation, *Least Action*, could be applied to relativistic mechanics and, as Feynman discovered, quantum mechanics.\n",

One of the great advantages of the Lagrangian formulation, is that you can use any convenient coordinates to describe your system. You do not have to use Cartesian x, y, coordinates. For the pendulum, I will use the angle from the vertical, $\\theta$.\n"
